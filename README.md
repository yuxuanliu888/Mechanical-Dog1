## Timeline

What did you do in each of the past four weeks?

- Week 1: Write Proposal, flush out initial code for your idea
- Week 2: Lear how to use servo motors and try to test all the servo motors I have.
- Week 3: Assemble the motors with motherboard and test.
- Week 4: Present!
 
## Challenges

I bought all the servo motors from amazon. Hence most of them didn't work even if I assembled it the right way. However, I didn't know what's wrong with them at the beginning. (Maybe I connect the wrong cable with a wrong leg? Maybe my code is wrong.) As a result. I spent a lot of time to find issues and test my motors. I also felt hard to assemble them and made them move. 
I tried to make a three legs robot at the beginning. After testing, I found that there are only 2 motors worked. The other 6 motors didn't work even if I assemble them in the right way. In the end, I simplified the robot into two legs and made it move.
